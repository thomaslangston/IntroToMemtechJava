This is the code samples from my Intro to Memtech: Java talk given at Launch Memphis.
This talk was on September 12th, 2011.

The code samples are a collectin of basic Java and Android applications including:
  Hello, World examples of each
  Some basic syntax examples
  Recursion example
  Inheiritance example
  Android app that launches a Twitter keyword search on 'memtech'

You'll need a JDK and Android SDK to compile the examples.
